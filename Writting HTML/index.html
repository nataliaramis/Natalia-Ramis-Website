            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> My name is Natalia Ramis and I’m an artist born and raised in Puerto Rico. I’ve 
                always loved to paint and create art since I was little, but it wasn’t until my sophomore 
                year of high school that I started getting more involved in art and decided to take an 
                elective that my school provided. At a quick blink of an eye, I grew a big fond toward not 
                only painting but the process of sketching, research, learning of techniques, and even 
                the critiques during class. My true dedication towards art came during my senior year in 
                the pandemic. I can strongly say that painting got me through this tough time we were 
                all going through. During this year I focused my artistic skills in my art portfolio which I 
                decided to base it off the symbolism of components in nature. This them took me a 
                while to figure out because I wanted this group of paintings to not only portray who I am 
                but tell a story. This was indeed the perfect them for me because of my love for nature 
                and the way I look into the deeper meanings of little things. Art has been everywhere in 
                my life since I can remember and since I’ve gotten to college, I fear that I have lost that 
                passion. This website is a way for me to express my love for the arts and share my 
                creations and thoughts with the world.</p>
